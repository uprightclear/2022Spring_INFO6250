# Loading Indicator
The Loading Indicator will be shown when you login in TodoList. In this app, I used `setTimeOut()` to make sure that the spinner will be shown. If your login request is invalid, you are able to click the spinner to back to the login page.

# Fake Services
To use this app, you have to start the proxy service at first ( http://localhost:4000 ). The fake service is used to store and manipulate the data of logged-in users.
