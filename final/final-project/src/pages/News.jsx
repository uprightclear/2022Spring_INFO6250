                    <h3>GIVING DAY CELEBRATION NETS A RECORD $3 MILLION FOR STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS</h3>
                    <p>In a record result that exceeded all forecasts, Northeastern Giving Day generated more than $3 million as the university community supported and celebrated a variety of student causes with more than 7,500 donations.</p>
                    <p>“The Northeastern community really got behind it,” said Catie Hsieh, senior associate director for leadership annual giving at Northeastern. “It was about everyone coming together to make such a big impact. And then the on-campus activities blew it out of the water.”</p>

                    <p>Amanda Brea says she has “unfinished business” in Spain after her study abroad program was cut short by the pandemic in 2020. Luckily, she’ll be returning to the country in September to begin a nine-month teaching position funded by the U.S. Fulbright Student Program. </p>
                    <p>Brea, who will graduate from Northeastern this spring with a degree in theater and marketing, will leave for the Canary Islands this fall to begin teaching English. All living and travel expenses will be covered by the Fulbright grant. </p>

                    <p>This week, Northeastern runners were lacing up and getting ready to toe the starting line at the Boston Marathon on Monday. Giving Day brought plenty of school spirit (and pies to the face), RISE offered an opportunity for students to show off their research projects, and the spring weather encouraged buds—and hammocks—to reemerge on the Boston campus.</p>
