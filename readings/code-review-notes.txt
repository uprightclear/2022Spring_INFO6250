* No commented out code
* No debugging code
* Your commit message finishes this single sentence: "The code in this commit _____"
* Be very cautious when creating a fixed width/height in CSS - prefer to allow the browser to automatically size items
* Don't mix tabs and spaces - whole repo must be consistent.
* Don't use var (and other JS best practices)
* Don't use html class names that describe the look
* Don't use alert() (and other JS best practices)
* Don't use HTML for how it will look; instead use semantic HTML
* Use meaningful variable/file/function names (and other JS best practices)
* Don't have functions that do too much - each function should be small and fill a single purpose
