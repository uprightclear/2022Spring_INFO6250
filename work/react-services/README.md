# React Services

* Start from the up-to-date main branch (`git checkout main; git pull origin main`)
* Create a feature branch named 'react-services' (`git checkout -b react-services`)
* Create a react application in this directory using create-react-app
* Modify and add files in `src/` to fulfill the requirements below
* Add, commit, and push the branch to github
* Create a PR to merge to main
* Be sure to include the TA(s) and I as reviewers on the PR.  
* Due by Sun Apr 10 11:59pm (PT)

## Goals

- Create a React application that makes use of REST-based services
- Have a service server that can serve the static files built by `npm run build`
- Configure the create-react-app (CRA) dev server to proxy service requests
- Demonstrate an understanding of the `useEffect` hook
- Demonstrate an understanding of displaying loading states

## Assignment Goals and Requirements
- The application will be a service-based todo list
- The user will log in, and the server maintains a separate list of todos for each user
- We will convert the files from the `service-login-todo` sample
  - Hint: this is important or you will have to do a lot more work!
- The user must be able to login/logout
- The page will check for login on page load (a user that is already logged in will not have to log in again)
- The list can have items marked as done/not-done, new items can be added, and existing items can be deleted
- Your application can be tested by running `npm install` and
  - running `npm start` to start the services server 
  - running (in a separate terminal) `npm dev` to start the dev server
    - Note: this shows you should change the `scripts` section of package.json
  - visiting http://localhost:3000 in the browser
- Your application can ALSO work by:
  - running `npm run build` to create the static files in `build/`
  - running `npm start` to start the server
  - visiting http://localhost:4000 in the browser

## Copying/Modifying the files from services-login-todo
- copy the server-side .js files from the sample into the created project directory
  - server.js
  - sessions.js
  - users.js
  - todos.js
- copy the client-side .js file from the sample /public directory into the created /src directory
- modify the server.js to use port 4000 instead of 3000
- modify the server.js to use `./build` for static files instead of public/
- rename the client-side .js file to be src/services.js (yes, `.js`, not `.jsx`)
- remove all the JS from services.js except the functions with names that begin with `fetch`
- export those functions
- pull over any css files from the sample public/ into the react project you want and modify as needed to match your resulting HTML
  - You can use the CSS in a different arrangement of files as well, write completely new CSS, whatever makes sense to you
- You are welcome to inspect the HTML generated by the render function for use in the React Components

## Updating the created package
- run `npm install express uuid cookie-parser` in the created react project directory (where the package.json file is)
- add `"proxy": "http://localhost:4000",` to the package.json

## Restrictions
- All components must be .jsx files named in MixedCase
- Components should have good separation of concerns
  - not too large
  - not doing too much
  - same logic as splitting up functions
- Components should have good, accurate, meaningful names
- state values should have good, accurate, meaningful names
- Component files should match the component name
- Components must each be in a single file with no other exported values
- Logic that is not about JSX should be imported from .js files
- .js files and functions should have good, accurate, meaningful names

## Additional Requirements
- You may not use `document.querySelector()` or otherwise query the DOM directly
- You may not use `useRef`, or `ref` props from React (If you do not know what I mean, that is fine)
- Follow the best practices described in class, in the code-review doc, and in the best-practices in the readings
- Use Semantic HTML as much as you can
- Follow any suggestions previously given to you in code reviews
- Do NOT include files in your PR that are outside the assignment (no IDE configs, `node_modules/`, etc)
  - Note: create-react-app installs many files.  For now, those are fine to include in your PR, except for `node_modules/`
- Do not use external CSS libraries
- You may not use floats to do more than manage flowing text with images
- You may not use HTML tables or CSS table layouts
- You may not use Set() or Map() (not the same as the .map() method on an array, that is allowed)
- You may not use CSS preprocessors, minifiers, or other tools to modify your CSS
  - I and the TA(s) must be able to read it easily
