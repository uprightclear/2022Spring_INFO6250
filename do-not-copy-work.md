# Do not copy work!

For the INFO6250 class, please do not copy the work of others.

I _encourage_ you to look at the work of your fellow students and various sources online.  There is a lot you can learn from reading the code of others.

However, for assignments, exams, and projects, please ONLY turn in your own work.  This class covers a lot of fundamental knowledge and it is important to for you to exercise those fundamentals.

Failure to follow this requirement can result in strict penalties, up to and including receiving a zero grade on the assignment in question, failing the course, or being expelled from the university, as noted in the Student Ethics guidelines you have all agreed to.
